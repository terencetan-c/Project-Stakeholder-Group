DMP is created using DMPonline:
https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/plans/152807/export.pdf?export%5Bquestion_headings%5D=true

Alternatively, it can be found on the list of public DMPs on the DMPonline website by searching for 'Shaping a modern approach to open data from a World-leading science facility'.

This serves as a live DMP for this project, and it will be updated over the course of the project as details of the digital objects become clearer.
