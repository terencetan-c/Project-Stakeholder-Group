# Project-Stakeholder-Group
Repository regarding the DPhil Project Stakeholder Group

My DPhil programme is a collaboration between the University of Oxford and Diamond Light Source that is aimed at understanding the technical, social and policy implications of adopting the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) Principles and evaluating the effects of its implementation on synchrotron data.

This Project Stakeholder Group was set up to obtain feedback regarding the novelty and usefulness of my project.
